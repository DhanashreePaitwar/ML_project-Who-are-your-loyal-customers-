Customer Segmentation project



PROJECT :-CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION  
                      WHO ARE YOUR LOYAL CUSTOMERS?
=====================================================================================================
Customer segmentation is a method to know who are our most loyal customers? and who vist our 
platform or e-commerce website frequently,
i.e for other purpose like to shop or to redeem coupons or getting some discounts in short one 
time visiters.
=====================================================================================================
In this project we will perform customer segmentation using machine learning.

* we would create several clusters according to there spending behaviour.
1. we would create clusters of most loyal customers as well as 
2. the customers who are at the verge of churning out.

=====================================================================================================
# 1] WHAT IS CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION?

* --> Customer segmentation is amethodology using which we can divide our customers base into group 
individuals who are similar in terms of either gender, spending behavious, frequency to visit,
age or other demographics.

* --> customer segmentation allows companies to to precisely target the customers who
has specific needs and desiers.

* --> This way companies can design the target campaigns to the right group of customers.

* --> It may also be a case while creation of this clusters company might identify new market segment
on which company can focus more as it might be more profitable.

* --> Using customer segmentation companies can identify customer groups which require extreme
attention such that people in that group are on the verge of churning out.

* --> we can find out there may be a group of customers or segments who has a highest potential
value.

* --> Customer segmentation can also help to create targeted strategies than can capture 
customer attention and create positive high value experiences with our brand.

* --> Customer segmentation can be performed based on our business requirement.

=====================================================================================================



Here in this project to segment customers we use-
1. RFM Score for each customer.
2. Create clusters using K-Means.

# RFM stands for
* R = recency   --> means how recently customer purchased the item or product.
                  The more recent the purchase is the better the score would be.
* F = frequency --> representes how often a customer purchases an item or product.
                  The more frequent they purchase is the better the scores would be for frequency.
* M = monetary  --> It represents how much the customer spends.
                  The more the amount the better monetry score would be.

====================================================================================================


In customer segmenting we can create 3 groups depends on RFM scoring and k-mean clustring as follows

1] High- This group has high RFM score, they are loyal customers,group who buys often, and visited 
platform recently. THIS IS THE GROUP YOU DONT WANT TO LOSE.

2] Medium- This group visit platform or e-commerce website but not as frequent as customers in
HIGH group, They spend comparatively less than the HIGH group, they have not purchase product
very recently , they have medium RFM scores.

3] low- This group of customers Low RFM values, who have not visited the ploatform long time
or visited tha platfor once like to redeem the coupons etc, they are in verge to churn out.
